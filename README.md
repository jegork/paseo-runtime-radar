# runtime-radar

A Paseo plugin that shows which ports and Docker containers belong to which worktree.

- **Runtime panel** (workspace tab or Explorer): this workspace's listening ports and containers,
  then everything else on the machine with its working directory.
- **Runtime radar** (sidebar): every open workspace with its ports and containers, then projects
  whose main checkout has processes but no open workspace, then anything unattributed.
- ⌘K: "Open runtime panel" in a workspace, "Open runtime radar" anywhere.

Read-only. Refreshes every five seconds while open.

## Install

```sh
paseo plugin add jegork/paseo-runtime-radar
```

Requires `lsof` on the daemon machine; `docker` is optional and its absence is shown on the panel.

## How attribution works

- Ports come from `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN`; each process's working directory is read with a second
  `lsof -d cwd`. A process whose cwd sits inside a workspace directory belongs to that workspace,
  deepest match first, so a worktree beats its project root.
- Containers come from `docker ps`. Compose sets `com.docker.compose.project.working_dir`, which is
  matched the same way. Plain `docker run` containers have no directory and show as unattributed.
- A host port a container publishes is held by Docker's proxy, so those listeners are folded into
  the container row rather than shown twice.
- A process whose cwd is unreadable (another user's) still shows, unattributed.
